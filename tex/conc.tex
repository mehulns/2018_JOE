\section{Conclusions}

A framework for intelligent autonomous landing on the seafloor has been proposed and developed. The conditions necessary for safe landing were identified, considering the geometry of the platform and selecting the optimal landing site based on a cost function. Implementation of the landing algorithm was simulated on seafloor data acquired using a similar high resolution mapping system. The design of an underwater platform was proposed by identifying the hardware required for landing. This work has provided tools for an AUV to perform observations on the seafloor with use of in-situ sensors autonomously.
